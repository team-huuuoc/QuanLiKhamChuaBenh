/*
  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `Patient` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `Patient` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - Added the required column `identify` to the `Patient` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
